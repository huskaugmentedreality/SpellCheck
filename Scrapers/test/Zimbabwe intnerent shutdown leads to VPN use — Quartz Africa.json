Zimbabweans have been\u00a0demonstrating against a 150% fuel price hike that would only make life more difficult in an already battered economy.\nBy Friday (Jan. 18), the internet was restored with some reporting access to Twitter, but Whatsapp, Facebook and YouTube remained blocked. That\u2019s when Zimbabweans turned to VPNs to stay in contact.\u00a0 VPNs (Virtual Private Network) use a technology\u00a0that circumvents geographical restrictions and censorship while keeping one\u2019s location and identity unknown.\nThe blackout has left Zimbabweans disconnected from the world, particularly from the Zimbabwean diaspora. Independent YouTube news outlets, like Bustop TV and 263Chat have effectively been silenced. Lawmakers in the US Senate joined calls from groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists to restore full internet access. A three-day internet blackout could cost Zimbabwe over $17 million in lost income and other revenue, according to digital rights organization Access Now.\nNon-governmental organizations such as the Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa-Zimbabwe) and Magamba Network tweeted advice on how to ue VPNs.\n\u201cI am excited that even if it is assumed by the state that we are offline, VPNs brought us back online,\u201d said Raymond Makuwaza, a young man from the city of Mutare who prefers Psiphon Pro.\nRest Makware, a student,\u00a0 said Thunder VPN has become part of his life, using it to access blocked apps.\u201cWhen the government ordered our mobile service providers to shut down certain media platforms I had no access to my favorite sites,\u201d he told Quartz.\nBestVPN, a UK-based service, said it had seen a 1,500% jump in VPN searches by Zimbabweans. A similar rise was seen in Uganda last year after the government introduced a social media tax.\nThe Zimbabwean government ostensibly blocked internet access to prevent activists from organizing after thousands heeded a call from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. Authorities threatened the executives of telcos who refused to comply with a hefty fine or up to three years imprisonment, according to Strive Masiyiwa, the founder of Zimbabwe\u2019s largest mobile service provider, Econet. Authorities also arrested pastor Evan Mawarire, the founder of the social media and YouTube movement #ThisFlag, who also called for demonstrations.\nZanu PF government is blaming its \u201cenemies for using social media to try to subvert a constitutionally elected government,\u201d state security minister Owen Ncube said in \u00a0a televised press briefing.\u00a0During the era of former president Robert Mugabe, the government blocked WhatsApp and appointed a minister to monitor social media use to stop dissent online.\nSign up to the\u00a0Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here\u00a0for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox\n"}
